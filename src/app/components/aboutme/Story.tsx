        I’m Ammar, a self-taught web developer who started out in a very
        different field. I didn’t come from a tech background—in fact, I have a
        diploma in Business Administration. But my passion for coding and web
        development grew unexpectedly, and it changed my life in ways I never
        imagined. <br />
        <br />
        In 2023, while studying to be a seaman, I discovered AI, specifically
        ChatGPT. I was amazed by how it worked and decided to learn coding, just
        for fun at first. After a week of self-study, I built my first simple
        website for one of my maritime instructors. She loved it, and that gave
        me the confidence to keep going. <br /> <br />
        Once I finished my seaman training, I continued learning coding and
        created more projects. In April 2023, I started my own freelance
        business, Hallucinations Digital, building websites for small
        businesses. Even though I was working as a cook at the time, I managed
        to get seven clients in just one year. It wasn’t easy, especially when I
        kept getting rejected for developer jobs, but I didn’t give up. <br />
        <br />
        In October 2023, I got a chance to join the MTDC TechnoTube event, where
        I was chosen to work on a project funded by RM 20K. At the same time, in
        February 2024, I got my first job as a web developer at Bubbles O2. Now,
        I’m balancing my full-time job with my side project, and I’m proud of
        the progress I’ve made. <br />
        <br />
        Looking back, it’s amazing to see how far I’ve come. Coding started as a
        hobby but turned into something I love doing every day. I’m still
        learning, and I plan to study Computer Science to get even better.{" "}
        <br />
        <br /> More than anything, I want to use my skills to help people. Every
        project I work on is aimed at making the world a better place. Lately,
        I’ve seen too much news about crime, scams, and cruelty, and it really
        bothers me. I believe the world can change, and I want to do my part.
        Whether it’s building platforms for safety or raising awareness, I want
        to make a difference. I’ve always been inspired by real-life heroes, the
        ones who work hard to help others. When I first started my t-shirt
        brand, Halusinasi, during my diploma, I wanted to share that message of
        heroism. Now, I’m doing it through web development. <br />
        <br /> Thank you for reading my story. This is just the start, and I’m
        excited to see where this journey takes me. Let’s work together and make
        an impact.
